    "## Environment Setup and Dependency Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial section establishes the foundational environment for working with the Contextual Memory Reweaving (CMR) system. The setup process involves three critical steps: path configuration, import verification, and device detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook dynamically locates the repository's Python package by constructing an absolute path to the `../python` directory. This approach ensures that imports resolve correctly regardless of where the notebook is executed within the project structure. The path is only added to `sys.path` if it's not already present, preventing duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "We verify that the core `CMRTransformer` class can be imported successfully from `models.base_transformer`. This import test serves as an early validation that:\n",
    "- The Python package structure is correct\n",
    "- All required dependencies are installed\n",
    "- The core CMR classes are accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Device Detection and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The system automatically detects the best available compute device using PyTorch's built-in detection methods:\n",
    "- **CUDA**: For NVIDIA GPU acceleration\n",
    "- **MPS**: For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) GPU acceleration  \n",
    "- **CPU**: Fallback for systems without GPU support\n",
    "\n",
    "This automatic device selection ensures optimal performance across different hardware configurations while maintaining compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portable Setup**: Works across different development environments\n",
    "- **Early Error Detection**: Catches configuration issues before model initialization\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Automatically selects the best available hardware\n",
    "- **Development Flexibility**: Supports both local development and production deployment"

    "## Configuration Management and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section establishes the core configuration parameters that control the CMR system's behavior. The configuration is designed to be both flexible and robust, with built-in validation to prevent common configuration errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection and Adapter Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration specifies which base model to use and how to adapt it for memory enhancement:\n",
    "- **ADAPTER_NAME**: Identifies the specific adapter implementation (e.g., \"gemma\", \"mistral\")\n",
    "- **MODEL_NAME**: Specifies the HuggingFace model identifier for the base transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Architecture Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Two critical parameters control the memory system's architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Layers\n",
    "`TARGET_LAYERS = [2, 4]` specifies which transformer layers will have memory hooks installed. The choice of layers is strategic:\n",
    "- **Early layers** (2): Capture lower-level linguistic features and patterns\n",
    "- **Middle layers** (4): Capture higher-level semantic representations\n",
    "- **Multiple layers**: Enable hierarchical memory capture across different abstraction levels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buffer Management\n",
    "`BUFFER_SIZE = 20` sets the maximum number of memory entries that can be stored per layer. This parameter balances:\n",
    "- **Memory capacity**: Larger buffers retain more historical context\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: Smaller buffers reduce retrieval overhead\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Optimal size depends on the specific use case and task requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration supports dual tokenization approaches:\n",
    "- **HuggingFace Tokenizer**: Production-ready, model-specific tokenization when available\n",
    "- **Toy Tokenizer**: Lightweight fallback for development and testing scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in validation ensures configuration integrity:\n",
    "- **Layer validation**: Verifies target layers exist in the model architecture\n",
    "- **Buffer validation**: Ensures buffer size is positive and reasonable\n",
    "- **Dependency checks**: Validates required components are available\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive configuration system provides the foundation for reliable, optimized CMR operation across diverse deployment scenarios."

    "## CMRTransformer Initialization and Architecture Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the core process of instantiating and configuring a CMRTransformer instance, which serves as the foundation for all memory-enhanced operations in the CMR system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal Configuration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization uses a `SimpleNamespace` object to provide only the essential configuration parameters required by the CMRTransformer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Parameters\n",
    "- **vocab_size**: Set to 50,257 (GPT-2 standard vocabulary size) for tokenization compatibility\n",
    "- **num_hidden_layers**: Set to 8 layers, providing sufficient depth for meaningful memory capture\n",
    "\n",
    "This minimal approach ensures compatibility while avoiding unnecessary configuration complexity that might cause initialization failures with incomplete model configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Configuration Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The `memory_config` dictionary specifies the memory system's operational parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Layer Selection\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "Configures which transformer layers will have memory hooks installed. The selection of layers 2 and 4 is strategic:\n",
    "- **Layer 2**: Captures early semantic representations and linguistic patterns\n",
    "- **Layer 4**: Captures more abstract, higher-level conceptual information\n",
    "- **Multi-layer approach**: Enables hierarchical memory capture across different levels of abstraction\n",

    "#### Buffer Management\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"buffer_size\": BUFFER_SIZE  # 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sets the maximum number of memory entries that can be stored per layer, balancing memory capacity with computational efficiency.\n",

    "The CMRTransformer is moved to the optimal available device (CPU/GPU/MPS) for best performance. The additional device assignment for nested layers addresses a specific technical consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nested Layer Device Assignment\n",
    "When using `SimpleNamespace` configurations (instead of full HuggingFace configs), nested transformer layers may not automatically inherit device placement. The explicit device assignment ensures all components operate on the same device, preventing tensor device mismatch errors.\n",

    "### Initialization Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "The successful initialization confirms:\n",
    "- **Model architecture**: All layers are properly instantiated\n",
    "- **Memory system**: Configuration is valid and applied\n",
    "- **Device placement**: All components are on the optimal compute device\n",

    "## Memory Hook Registration and Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the activation of the CMR system's core memory capture mechanism through the registration of forward hooks on specified transformer layers. Hook registration is the critical step that enables real-time memory capture during model inference.\n",

    "### Hook Registration Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The `register_memory_hooks()` method installs forward hooks on the target layers:\n",

    "#### Automatic Hook Installation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cmr.register_memory_hooks()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This single method call:\n",
    "- Iterates through all specified target layers\n",
    "- Installs custom forward hooks on each layer\n",
    "- Configures hooks to capture hidden states during forward passes\n",
    "- Registers hooks in the model's hook registry for later management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hook Functionality\n",
    "Each registered hook performs several critical functions:\n",
    "- **State Capture**: Extracts hidden states as they pass through the layer\n",
    "- **Metadata Collection**: Records layer index, sequence position, and timing information\n",
    "- **Relevance Scoring**: Applies initial relevance assessment to captured states\n",
    "- **Memory Storage**: Adds captured states to the appropriate memory buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hook Registry Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The system maintains a comprehensive registry of active hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registry Structure\n",
    "```python\n",
    "active_hook_layers = sorted(list(cmr.layer_hooks.keys()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `layer_hooks` dictionary maps layer indices to their respective hook handles, enabling:\n",
    "- **Hook tracking**: Know exactly which layers have active hooks\n",
    "- **Selective management**: Enable/disable hooks on specific layers\n",
    "- **Cleanup operations**: Properly remove hooks when no longer needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registry Benefits\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into which layers are being monitored\n",
    "- **Control**: Ability to dynamically modify hook configuration\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Easy identification of hook-related issues\n",
    "- **Resource management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory System Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hook registration activates the memory system's core functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-time Capture\n",
    "Once hooks are registered, every forward pass through the model will:\n",
    "- Automatically capture hidden states from target layers\n",
    "- Apply relevance scoring to determine memory worthiness\n",
    "- Store significant states in layer-specific memory buffers\n",
    "- Update sequence tracking and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Considerations\n",
    "The hook system is designed for minimal performance impact:\n",
    "- **Selective capture**: Only specified layers are monitored\n",
    "- **Efficient storage**: States are processed and stored asynchronously\n",
    "- **Memory management**: Automatic buffer management prevents memory overflow\n",
    "- **Optional activation**: Hooks can be disabled when memory capture isn't needed\n",
