# Contextual Memory Reweaving (CMR) Project Wiki

**[Experimental]** *This project represents cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence memory systems and is currently in active development.*

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Contextual Memory Reweaving (CMR) project introduces a breakthrough approach to language model memory, based on pioneering research by Frederick Dillon, Gregor Halvorsen, Simon Tattershall, Magnus Rowntree, and Gareth Vanderpool. Our goal is to create the next generation of AI memory systems that can remember and recall contextual information across conversations and tasks.

**Research Foundation:** *"Contextual Memory Reweaving in Large Language Models Using Layered Latent State Reconstruction"* - [CITE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02046v1)

## 🚀 What We're Building

CMR represents a new category of AI memory that goes beyond traditional approaches. Instead of simple context windows, our system creates persistent, intelligent memory that:

- **Learns from Experience** - Captures and stores meaningful information from interactions
- **Recalls Contextually** - Retrieves relevant memories based on current conversation context  
- **Adapts Continuously** - Improves memory selection and quality over time
- **Scales Efficiently** - Handles large memory stores without performance degradation
