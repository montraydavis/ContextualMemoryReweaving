# MistralCMRModel

## Overview
`MistralCMRModel` is a specialized implementation of the CMR system optimized for Mistral language models. It provides enhanced integration and performance optimizations specifically designed for the Mistral architecture.

## Key Features
- Optimized for Mistral model architecture
- 8-bit quantization support
- Specialized memory handling for Mistral's attention mechanisms
- Efficient state capture and reconstruction
- Native integration with Mistral's sliding window attention

## Usage
```python
from integration.mistral_integration import create_mistral_cmr_model

# Create and initialize Mistral CMR model
model = create_mistral_cmr_model(
    model_name="mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410",
    use_quantization=True,
    device="auto"
)

# Use the model with CMR capabilities
outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=512,
    use_memory=True,
    return_memory_info=True
)
```

## Mistral-Specific Optimizations
- **Architecture Optimization**: Tailored for Mistral's architecture
- **Quantization Support**: 8-bit precision to reduce memory usage
- **Attention Handling**: Specialized processing for Mistral's attention patterns
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory usage for Mistral's context windows

## Configuration
Configure using the following parameters:
- `model_name`: Pretrained Mistral model identifier
- `use_quantization`: Enable 8-bit quantization
- `device`: Computation device ('auto', 'cuda', 'cpu')
- `cmr_config`: CMR-specific configuration

## Best Practices
- Enable quantization for memory-constrained environments
- Use appropriate device settings for optimal performance
- Monitor memory usage with large context windows
- Consider Mistral's sliding window attention in your use case
